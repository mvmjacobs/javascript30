			// however what happens when we update that array?
			//team[3] = 'Foo';

			// now here is the problem!
			// oh no - we have edited the original array too!
			// Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
			// So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
			
			// one way
			const team2 = players.slice();

			const team3 = [].concat(players);

			// or use the new ES6 Spread
			const team4 = [...players];

			// or
			const team5 = Array.from(players);

			// now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
			// The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object
			// with Objects
			const person = {
				name: 'Mark',
				age: 24

			// and think we make a copy:
			// const captain = person;
			// captain.number = 99;

			// how do we take a copy instead?
			const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99, age: 80 });
			console.log(captain2);

			// We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
			//const captain3 = {...person};

			// Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
